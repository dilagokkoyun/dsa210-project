# Spotify Listenings & University Exam Schedule Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore two distinct but interesting datasets: **Tendency of Music Listening** and **University Exam Schedule**. The goal is to analyze the relationship between music genre preferences (as reflected in Spotify listening habits) and the timing of university exams. By examining patterns in listening behavior, I hope to uncover insights into how students' music choices might correlate with exam periods and potentially aid in stress management or study habits.

### Key Questions:
- How do listening habits (e.g., genre preferences, listening times) correlate with exam schedules?

## Datasets

### 1. **Spotify Listenings Data**
- **Data to include:**
  - Genre of the song (e.g., Pop, Rock, Classical)
  - Timestamp (when the song was played)
  - Frequency of listens

### 2. **University Exam Schedule**
- **Data to include:**
  - Exam dates and times
  - Courses and subjects
  - Exam duration

## Project Plan

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - I will download **Spotify listenings data** from **Spotify** to extract information such as song genres, timestamps, and the frequency of listens.
   - I will collect the **university exam schedule** from the official university website or related documents to get exam dates, times, courses, and durations.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - I will clean and preprocess the datasets to handle missing values and standardize formats.
   - For the **Spotify data**, I will explore trends in genre preferences, listening times, and the frequency of listening over different periods (e.g., day vs. night, weekdays vs. weekends).
   - I will also analyze the **exam schedule** to identify patterns in exam distribution across the semester and peak stress periods.

### 3. **Visualization**
   - I will create **visualizations** to show the distribution of genres over time, highlighting peak listening times.
   - I will plot the **exam schedule** and analyze the relationship between exam periods and listening behavior (e.g., do students tend to listen to calming genres closer to exam times?).
   - Heatmaps, bar charts, and time series plots will be used to communicate the findings clearly.

### 4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - If applicable, I will apply machine learning models to predict **listening behavior** based on the exam schedule or time of day.
